# Data-Structures-Project
A C based program for PAKabs employees to add, view and delete passengers according to the bookings made. The passenger details are added to a queue. New passengers are enqueued and the passengers who have been dropped off are dequeued. The details of the current passenger can be viewed by looking at the front of the queue.
